## Overview

The Starvation Evasion Game is a multiplayer Client/Server game.<br>
First, the server should be started on one machine. The server will create an instance
of the simulator and manage client connections. The server then starts n=0 through
7 AI clients and waits for 7-n player client connections.<br><br>

Each player client is started on a separate computer and connects to the server via TCP/IP.<br><br>


## Compilation and Project Configuration

<ul>
<li>Libraries: javafx-mx, sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2</li>
<li>Source Folders: src, libs</li>
<li>Resource Folders: data, assets</li>
<li>Run Folder: bin</li>
<li>Dependencies: JDK 1.8, javafx-mx, sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2</li>
</ul>

## Starting up the Game
The client entry point is:<br>
<tt>starvationevasion.client.Setup.Main</tt> Running this should ask you for single or multi-player.
Multi-player will attempt to connect to <tt>foodgame.cs.unm.edu:5555</tt>.
Assuming the server is up and running, this will work. <br><br>

Selecting single player requires that you first start a local server. the server entry point is:
<tt>starvationevasion.server.Server</tt>. The default port is 5555.
