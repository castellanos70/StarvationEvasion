IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN GAME RULES, UPDATE THIS FILE.

Rules for the "card game" aspect of the StarvationEvasion project:

1) Each player will have 7 cards in their hands at the beginning of each round

2) Types of cards: 
    -Instant (has an effect instantly after playing, ie: "Get 5 million dollars")
    -Automatic (card will not take effect instantly, but is a policy that doesn't require
      other regions to vote on. ie: "Provide a corn subsidy for farmers in your region")
    -Votable (Other regions will vote on this card during the voting phase, ie: "Every 
      region sends 10 million dollars to help South Asia")

3) Cards are generally used during the "DRAFTING" state (see file server.model.state.java).
   Some cards, however, can be played during a "POLICY_REVEAL" state. The only example of
   this is the "Filibuster" card. The "POLICY_REVEAL" state is just before regions can
   vote on Votable policies, but after drafting, and just after those policies are shown
   to everyone. In this example, the Filibuster works by taking one of those revealed 
   policies and sending it back to the hand of the person who played it.
   Note that as of writing, this "POLICY_REVEAL" state is NOT in server.model.State. It 
   needs to be implemented before cards that are to be used in that state can work.
   
4) Each card has an "Action Point" value between 1-3, and each player has a set amount of 
   Action Points to use every turn (currently 3). Each card played will take away it's value
   from the player's Action Points that turn. Example: Beginning of the turn, start with 3 AP.
   Play a card with a value of 2 AP, and now with only 1 AP left over, the player can only 
   play cards with a value of 1 AP, should they have any in their hand.
     -note: see common.Constant.java is where each player's starting AP each turn is defined
