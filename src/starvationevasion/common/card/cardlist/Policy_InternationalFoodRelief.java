/**
 * Title: {@value #TITLE}<br><br>

 * Draft Affects: When drafting this policy, player

 *
 * Votes Required: {@value #VOTES_REQUIRED} through all<br>
 * Eligible Regions: All U.S.<br><br>
 *
 * Model Effects: Commodity food is distributed to relief world hunger
 * in the most efficient manner discovered by the sim where
 * efficiency calculation is based on the type of commodity
 * available in each participating region, each
 * country's nutritional need and each country's import penalty function.
 * Note: depending on yields, different regions may contribute different
 *    mixes of commodities.<br><br>
 * Note: Not all foods sent will necessarily go to the same region.<br><br>
 *
 * 10% bonus to effectiveness of total dollars spent per participating region.<br><br>
 *
 * Food purchased for relief inflates the global sell foodPrice of the food type by a
 * direct reduction of supply without effect on demand (since those to whom the
 * relief is delivered are presumed to lack the resources to have been part of the demand).
